# IA-FIB-LocalSearch

### Requirements
- Java 8
- AIMA library for Java
- RedSensores.jar

### Execution
From the terminal run `java -jar LocalSearch.jar`, and then just follow the options shown in the screen.

There's an already compiled jar in `out/artifacts/LocalSearch_jar` folder. If some changes are needed, import the
project in some **IDE** and generate the **JAR** there or just compile it manually with **javac**.

### Data

Data generated in experiments are stored in the experiments folder, where can also be found some charts used in the
documentation. To generate statistical reports from these data, use the **RScript** written in the scripts folder.

Documentation raw text can be also found and modified in `main.text`.
